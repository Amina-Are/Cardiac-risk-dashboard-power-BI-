Cardiac Risk & Social Determinants Dashboard

This Power BI dashboard explores patient-level cardiac risk in relation to smoking status, appointment adherence, chronic conditions, and borough-level social determinants.

Key Visuals

- **Smoking Prevalence by Borough**: Highlights disparities across London boroughs, with Brent showing unexpectedly high rates.
- **Cardiac Risk vs Smoking Status**: Shows elevated risk among smokers, supporting behavioral health interventions.
- **BMI by Ethnicity and Risk Category**: Surfaces disparities in obesity and risk clustering.
- **Attendance vs Risk**: Links missed appointments to higher risk categories.
- **Brent Paradox Visual**: Combines smoking, life expectancy, and IMD to challenge assumptions about deprivation and behavior.

Insights

- Brentâ€™s high smoking prevalence despite lower IMD may reflect stress-related behavior, financial access, and healthcare availability.
- Smokers in the patient dataset show significantly higher cardiac risk scores.
- Ethnic disparities in BMI and chronic conditions suggest targeted interventions are needed.

Notes

This dashboard was built using Power BI Desktop and reflects synthetic or anonymized data for portfolio purposes. No patient-identifiable information is included.
